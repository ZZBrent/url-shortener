# URL Shortener

I created this URL shortener as part of my Free Code Camp projects, [view my others here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/zzbrent).

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), and [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) installed.

You can also vist the app live by going to the [Heroku link](https://tranquil-river-73769.herokuapp.com/).
